💼 Frontend Engineer at BNY, part of the graduate scheme

💻 Passionate about clean code, modern UI, and performance

🌟 Recently completed a Frontend Development internship at Grafana Labs, contributing to open-source and design systems. Previously graduated from a rigorous Software Engineering bootcamp.
